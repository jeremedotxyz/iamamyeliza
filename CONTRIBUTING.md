# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project.

Before continuing, please note: this repository is primarily a personal site and an authored space. Contributions are welcome only where they align with the intent and tone of the project.

This is not an open experiment.
It is a maintained home.

## Philosophy of contribution

Contributions should be:
- respectful
- minimal
- clearly motivated by care, not cleverness

If a change makes the site louder, faster, trendier, or more complicated, it is unlikely to be accepted.

If a change improves clarity, accessibility, or durability, it may be considered.

---

## What is appropriate

- Small fixes (typos, broken links)
- Accessibility improvements
- Clear, documented bug fixes
- Suggestions that respect the site’s restraint

---

## What is not appropriate

- Feature requests aimed at growth, monetization, or engagement
- Design changes that add visual noise
- Refactors that increase complexity without necessity
- “Have you considered turning this into a platform?” energy

Please do not:
- rebrand the voice
- optimize the tone
- add tracking, analytics, or dark patterns
- suggest social integrations

This site is intentionally not those things.

---

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue describing the change clearly and calmly
2. Explain *why* the change matters
3. Keep scope small

If you’re unsure whether something belongs here, it probably doesn’t—and that’s okay.

---

## Code of conduct (briefly)

Be kind.
Be direct.
Do not be weird.

Respect that this is someone’s authored space, not a sandbox.

---

## Final note

Not every project wants to grow.
Some want to hold.

Thank you for understanding.
