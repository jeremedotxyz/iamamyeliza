# iamamyeliza

This repository contains the source for **iamamyeliza.xyz** — the personal website of a prolific writer.

The site is intentionally restrained. It is designed to hold writing, authorship, and presence without spectacle. There are no feeds to refresh, no timelines to chase, no prompts asking for engagement. What exists here is meant to be read slowly and returned to when needed.

This is not a performance space.
It is a place.

## What this is

iamamyeliza.xyz is a static, typography-forward website created to serve as a durable home for written work and identity on the web.

It prioritizes:
- legibility over novelty
- calm over velocity
- authorship over optimization

The site does not attempt to explain itself loudly. It assumes a reader who is paying attention.

## Why this exists

The modern internet is excellent at circulation and poor at keeping.

Writing is often asked to perform before it is allowed to exist. Authors are encouraged to be visible before they are ready, loud before they are clear, optimized before they are finished becoming.

This site exists as a refusal of that pressure.

iamamyeliza.xyz exists because:
- not all work benefits from immediacy
- not all writers want an audience before a room
- not all value can be measured in reach

It is a place where writing can sit without being extracted, summarized, or gamified. A place where presence does not require explanation. A place where identity is allowed to be quiet, incomplete, and intact.

## Design approach

The design of this site is deliberately minimal and conservative.

Choices were made to reduce friction rather than add features:
- static pages instead of frameworks
- minimal JavaScript
- typography as the primary design system
- layouts that age well rather than chase trends

Nothing here is accidental, and nothing is ornamental without purpose.

The site should feel calm to inhabit.
If it ever feels busy, something has gone wrong.

## Quiet builders & invisible confetti

This project aligns with a simple philosophy:  
**quiet builders change everything.**

Progress does not always announce itself.
Care often leaves no paper trail.
Impact is frequently invisible until much later.

This site honors:
- small, consistent effort
- thoughtful restraint
- work done without demanding recognition

Any value created here is allowed to accumulate quietly. The goal is not applause, but alignment.

Invisible confetti is still confetti.
